# my_tools
some tools I wrote for my own purpose 
Hello, (this is a quick and dirty translation from german to english)

in this directory are source and exe files to my tools.
The code is partially commented (for me)


I continue to develop these tools, but make the current state (source and EXE) available for free use / extension *.
Just a mention in the sense of: Original Code & Idea (c) Deutschmann Walter Email: mark_dowen@outlook.com, would be nice 

Quick Guide to Worldcreator:

Requirements:
Windows 10 * 64 bit, 2GB RAM, I5 / I7, Atom .... processor, graphics: from Intel 620,
Minimum display resolution: 1280 x 720

* older / other versions of Windows may work, has not been tested.



How does it work?

the menus should be self-explanatory.

The following is important:
If there is an error message that Worldcreator does not find any files and asks for the "Resource" file:
Please select the folder in which the map graphics are located, they must be defined by an * ai42 * file. This must
in the same folder as the graphic itself.

Or define Resourcepath via "Settings" -> "SetResourcePath".

Left mouse button puts graphics in the map, on the work plane, which is selected via the menu bar.

Right mouse button deletes objects of the selected / active level.

For erasing, any graphic is taken from the toolbar (this also serves as mouse pointer)





Where can I get the * ai42 file?

The AI42 Creator

Requirements:
Windows 10 * 64 bit, 2GB RAM, I5 / I7, Atom .... processor, graphics: from Intel 620,
Minimum display resolution: 1280 x 720

* older / other versions of Windows may work, has not been tested.


The AI42 Creator is another tool that helps me to create:
most important file: ai42.ai42, this contains all basic keywords (which are what and what they cause, is up to you )

I have chosen these for clarity as the variables of my structure / lists of my GameEngine.
The WorldCreator is unfortunately not consistent in this respect, as it emerged from a different situation.

to assign the properties to a graphic: In the menu select "Load Object", then select "Save As", a file named "name_der_grafik.ai42" is automatically offered for saving.
Confirm the requester and the file will be saved. This file can be processed by MapCreator.


So now I'm tired of writing instructions 

here are the short tutorials:
